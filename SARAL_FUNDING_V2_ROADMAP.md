## PHASE 0 — PLAY STORE LAUNCH BLOCKERS
*Must complete before any public release. Est: 5–7 days total.*

| # | Improvement | R | U | Effort | Why Now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | **Disable mock OTP; wire Firebase Phone Auth in frontend** | 5 | 5 | M | Security critical — current `123456` code is a backdoor |
| 0.2 | **OTP rate limiting** (max 3 attempts / 10 min per mobile) | 5 | 4 | S | Prevent SMS bombing |
| 0.3 | **JWT token signing + expiry** (replace UUID as token) | 5 | 4 | M | Current tokens never expire and aren't signed |
| 0.4 | **Privacy Policy + Terms of Service screens** | 3 | 3 | S | Play Store requirement — hard reject without these |
| 0.5 | **Production app icon + splash screen** | 2 | 5 | S | Store listing quality; first impression |
| 0.6 | **Offline / no-internet error state** | 2 | 5 | S | App currently crashes silently with no backend |
| 0.7 | **MongoDB indexes** (`user_id`, `mobile`, `scheme_id`) | 4 | 4 | S | Without indexes, every query is a full scan |
| 0.8 | **Push notifications (FCM)** | 4 | 5 | L | Alerts exist in DB but never delivered to device |
| 0.9 | **CORS lock-down** (replace `*` with production domain) | 3 | 1 | S | Security hygiene |
| 0.10 | **Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` + document `.env`** | 3 | 5 | S | App crashes with no backend URL |
